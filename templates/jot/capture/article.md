### Content Requirements

**IMPORTANT: Generate rich, detailed content. Target 60-100+ lines.**

1. **Summary**: 2-3 complete sentences, not just the headline
2. **Key Insight**: One powerful TL;DR sentence
3. **Key Points**: 4-5 distinct takeaways, each a complete thought
4. **Details**:
   - Break into 2-3 subsections with headers
   - Use numbered lists for processes/frameworks
   - Use bullet points for criteria/components
   - Include specific examples or use cases
5. **Key Arguments**: Explain the author's reasoning, not just conclusions
6. **Tags**: 1-2 thematic/domain tags only (e.g. `Dev Tools`, `Technology`). Do NOT generate descriptive tags that mirror the object name or features.

### What to Extract

- Main thesis and arguments
- Frameworks, processes, or methodologies mentioned
- Specific examples and case studies
- Statistics and data points
- Actionable recommendations
- Related resources mentioned

### Rules

- **REQUIRED: Ask for discovery context** - "How did you discover this article? What caught your attention?"
- **Write in first person** - these are personal notes (use "I think", "I found")
- **Use emojis on headings** exactly as shown
- **1-2 thematic tags only** — domain/use-case categories that cluster related objects (e.g. `Dev Tools`, `Agentic AI`). Never use the object's own name as a tag. Reuse existing Capacities tags before creating new ones.
- **Be concise but capture essential information** - don't pad, but don't skip important details
- **Extract actionable insights** - what can be applied?
- **Note statistics and data points** - specific numbers are valuable
- **Filename**: `slugified-title.md` (no date prefix)
- **Save to**: `notes/articles/`
- Output only markdown, no preamble
